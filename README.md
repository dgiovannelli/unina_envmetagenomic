Introductory class in Environmental Metagenomic for graduate students pursuing a Master Degree in Biology with a focus in environmental sciences. The class gives a recap of basic microbiology and microbial ecology concepts and then jumps into a 20 hours hand-on metagenomic analysis of publicly available dataset using web-based tools. The course is designed to provide background and realistic (albeit simplified) hands on experience with metagenomic dataset. Students select a matagenomic study and use the publicly deposited data to reanalyze the community diversity and function using a read-based approach, and make a short presentation on their findings comparing the results with the original study.

In the repository you'll find the different version of the class relative to each academic year. I always try to improve the class material year on year, so I suggest if interested to use the latest available year.
